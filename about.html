                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lakehouse Press was born from a simple belief: every author deserves a chance to share their story with the world. 
                        As a small, independent publisher, we understand the challenges that indie authors face. We've been there ourselves, 
                        navigating the complex world of publishing, and we wanted to create a space where authors feel supported, valued, and heard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our name comes from the idea of a peaceful retreat—a place where creativity flows, stories come to life, and authors 
                        can focus on what they do best: writing. Just like a lakehouse offers tranquility and inspiration, we aim to provide 
                        a calm, supportive environment for your publishing journey.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        We're not a big corporation with layers of bureaucracy. We're a mom & pop operation that treats every author like family.
