                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are a mom & pop indie press that enjoy using our combined skillsets to help indie authors achieve their dream!
                    </p>

                        There's a lot to learn about independent publishing and the industry changes day by day. While we can't claim to be experts in the field, we are happy to help share what we know to make a fledgling author's path just a bit easier.

                        Josh and Elizabeth Lake have a lot of interests, but words have always held a key place in their relationship, be it Scrabble or a shared love of reading. Elizabeth holds a BA in writing, has interned at several publishing houses, and created stories and marketing for numerous institutions and programs. Josh, a teacher by day, has a passion for all things techy, including a variety of specialized design skills. Our press first supported a family member as she published her memoir, but we're looking forward to doing a lot more!

                        Prices vary by job, genre, book length, time of year, and services needed. As this press is our own passion project, availability may vary based on our interest. (Primary interests are fiction projects in the fantasy and sci-fi genres, all ages.)

                    <h2>Important Note</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will not publish your book for you. We can support you through all stages of the manuscript development process and as you upload your book to various POD services, but you will maintain complete control of your copyright, revenue, ads, and promotions and qualify as an official 'indie author.'

                        Ready to bring your book to life? We'd love to hear about your project and discuss how we can help. Every project is unique, and we tailor our services to meet your specific needs.
